# JOB-SCHEDULER
it is a project which schedules a set of jobs which are given in a text file in that format:
  jobid:burstTime;MemoryRequierd.
# THE ALGORITHMS:
* Shortest Job First
* First Come First Serve
* Round robin

## notes
* there are some unrealistic things in Round robin but we made it only for test and try, it is not implemented like this in real world.
* You need to edit the file name in the code and some other parameters if you which to try it.
